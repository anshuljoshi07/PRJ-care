        <h2>About Us</h2>
        At PRJ Care Foundation, we are dedicated to transforming the lives of
        underprivileged children through education and enrichment activities.
        Based in New Delhi, India, our foundation provides free classes in
        English, Hindi, and Maths, helping over 100 kids take their first steps
        toward literacy. In 2023, we supported 25 children in enrolling in
        school for the first time and offered additional classes to help them
        catch up with their peers. Our weekly events, including cleanliness and
        plantation drives, festive celebrations, and creative activities, foster
        a sense of community and joy. With the help of our passionate volunteers
        and generous donors, we strive to empower the next generation and create
        a brighter future for all. Join us in making a difference today!

        <h2>Our Values</h2>
        At PRJ Care Foundation, our core values are rooted in upholding human
        dignity and leveraging the world's surplus to create positive change. We
        believe in: <br />
        Respecting the dignity of all individuals, including ourselves, our
        partners, and the communities we serve. Embracing localized solutions
        that harness local resources, wisdom, and efforts. Improving before
        changing, by valuing and exploring the potential of existing resources,
        and promoting circularity in all aspects. Fostering collaboration in
        every sphere to increase effectiveness and scale. Recognizing every
        entity as a stakeholder in the development process. Prioritizing the
        often-overlooked, including marginalized people, underutilized
        materials, unmet needs, neglected issues, and underserved geographies
        and relationships. <br />These values guide our actions and decisions,
        ensuring that we work towards a more equitable and sustainable future
        for all.

        the differences between Right and Wrong. <br />"I've taught these
        children and had a rather vivid and enlightening experience with them. I
        left with an easy heart knowinf that there are people out there who
        truly work for the betterment of our society. I would like to end by
        saying... "What is Knowledge indeed, if we shut it in a box and not
        share it?"

        <h2>Our Impact</h2>
        At PRJ Care Foundation, we're committed to creating a positive impact in
        our community and beyond. In the past year, we've made significant
        strides in promoting environmental sustainability, civic engagement, and
        healthy living. Our plantation drive saw us planting over 100 trees,
        helping to reduce carbon footprint and preserve biodiversity. We also
        launched a voting campaign, empowering 1000+ citizens to exercise their
        right to vote and shape the future of our democracy. Additionally, we
        celebrated key milestones like Yoga Day, Earth Day, and Republic Day,
        using these opportunities to raise awareness about the importance of
        physical and mental well-being, environmental conservation, and national
        unity. Through these initiatives, we've made a tangible difference in
        the lives of 2000+ people, and we're proud to continue our work towards
        building a better tomorrow.<br />
